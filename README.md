# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

This exercise involved employing different techniques to train and evaluate machine learning models with unbalanced classes, using a credit card credit dataset from LendingClub. The goal of the exercise was to determine which sampling strategy yielded the most accurate results in order to predict credit risk.

* Deliverable 1: Sampling the data and evaluating results with RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, and ClusterCentroids
* Deliverable 2: Using a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm
* Deliverable 3: Comparing and evaluating results from BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier


## Results

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
